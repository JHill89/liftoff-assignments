# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am creating a book tracker app. It will track the books you have read, are reading, or want to read. This gives the user the ability to organise and prioritize books on their radar and the ability to remember books they have read as well as take notes and give final thoughts. It will be very handy because I have forgotten the title and/or author of so many good books that I want to recommend to friends or I want to reread or I really liked the author and want to check out their other books. This will allow the user to save all that information as well as rate the book and save favorite quotes and even to track the page they are on in the book they are currently reading. 


### Features
Add Book: Can add a new book (title, author, genre, quotes, etc).
Edit Book: Can edit an already existing book. Can change the rating, table it belongs to, add quotes.
Search Bar: Can search through books with a keyword. Can search title, author, genre, or all.


### Technologies
    Java
    Spring Boot
    MySQL
    Hibernate
    Thymeleaf templates
    Javascript


### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn how to incorporate some Javascript to allow more functionality for the user on the front end. I want to make the lists easily sortable to the user.
